# tarot
A simple app for displaying the meaning of Tarot cards in a layout. The app is in early stages of development and needs more layouts programmed. The app can handle multiple types of decks.

The SQL file to create the database is not included, if you would like it, please just send an email to danny@dewdevelopment.com and I'll send it to you. Seriously, the process of doing the data entry for each card is a bit tedious. In asking for the SQL I will include the card details for the Crawley deck.

Installation is quite easy:
1) Create the database and tables needed (again, you can get the SQL from me)
2) Modify the config.php file to contain your details
3) Then upload all files to your server webroot.

If you have any questions feel free to send me an email.
